# Autonomous Multi-Agent Red-Blue Framework

Final Year Project:

**AN AUTONOMOUS MULTI-AGENT RED-BLUE FRAMEWORK FOR WEB APPLICATION VULNERABILITY DETECTION AND REMEDIATION**

## Current Status

**Milestone 8 — Red Team MVP: local implementation and automated tests PASS; Docker runtime verification PENDING**

Milestones 1–7 are complete. Docker isolation and the deterministic registered security-test harness were runtime-verified in Milestones 5 and 7.

Milestone 8 now adds the typed `agents/` reasoning layer, a provider-neutral `llm/` interface with deterministic `MockProvider`, bounded reconnaissance/planning inputs, and `orchestrator/red_team_flow.py` around the existing policy-controlled executor.

The deliberately vulnerable application and controlled security-test executor are implemented. Blue Team agents, patch automation, experiment execution, real cloud LLM providers, and the dashboard remain intentionally locked for later milestones.

## Approved Scope

The MVP is limited to a deliberately vulnerable local dummy application and three controlled vulnerability categories:

1. SQL Injection
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Directory / Path Traversal

The framework must not scan or test real websites, public IP addresses, external servers, private organizations, production systems, or unauthorized targets.

## Core Design Rule

LLMs may recommend actions.

Deterministic project services decide whether those actions are allowed and perform sensitive operations.

LLM agents will not receive unrestricted shell, network, Docker, Git, or host-filesystem access.

## Requirements

Recommended:

- Python 3.11–3.14
- Git
- Docker / Docker Compose (required in later milestones)
- Node.js (required later for the React dashboard)

## Linux Setup

```bash
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
cd autonomous-red-blue-fyp

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest
```

## Windows PowerShell Setup

```powershell
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>
Set-Location autonomous-red-blue-fyp

py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"

pytest
```

If PowerShell blocks virtual-environment activation, use an appropriate local execution-policy setting according to your machine/university policy instead of disabling security controls globally.

## Basic Verification

Run:

```bash
python -m compileall -q \
  agents orchestrator schemas services llm dummy_apps infrastructure security_tests
python -m pytest -q -p no:cacheprovider
```

Current automated result:

```text
Python compilation: PASS
Pytest: 96 passed in 0.81s
Docker Milestone 8 runtime verification: PENDING
```

## Configuration

The repository uses environment variables for runtime configuration.

Copy `.env.example` only as a reference. The current foundation does not automatically load `.env` files.

Initial variables:

```text
FYP_ENV=development
FYP_DATA_DIR=./data
FYP_DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/fyp.db
```

Never commit real API keys or passwords.

Cloud-model credentials will be added only when a provider integration is implemented.

```

The top-level `agents/` package is the frozen Phase 1 untrusted reasoning layer. It is distinct from `llm/` provider mechanics, `orchestrator/` coordination, and deterministic `services/`.

## Development Order

The immediate order is:

1. Repository foundation
2. Core schemas and configuration
3. Dummy application baseline
4. Controlled vulnerability scenarios
5. Docker isolation and reset
6. Target registry and policy engine
7. Deterministic security-test harness
8. Red Team MVP
9. Structured logging and Blue Team
10. Patching, Git, and verification
11. Experiments and dashboard

See `docs/phase-1/MILESTONES.md` for the complete plan.

## Tests First

A milestone is not complete because code exists.

Use:

**DESIGN → IMPLEMENT → TEST → VERIFY → DOCUMENT → COMMIT**

## Important Safety Notes

- Use synthetic data only.
- Do not expose the future vulnerable app publicly.
- Do not mount the Docker socket into attack or verification containers.
- Do not provide LLM agents a general shell tool.
- Do not automatically merge generated patches.
- Keep experiment failures; they are valid research data.

## Current Dummy Application

The baseline app lives at:

```text
dummy_apps/vulnerable_store/
```

Run it locally from the repository root:

```bash
python -m dummy_apps.vulnerable_store.app.reset
uvicorn dummy_apps.vulnerable_store.app.main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Seeded synthetic users:

```text
student1 / demo-pass-1
student2 / demo-pass-2
```

## Controlled Scenario Routes

```text
POST /scenarios/sql-injection/login
GET  /scenarios/xss/search
GET  /scenarios/path-traversal/read
```

The baseline routes remain available for regression testing.

The path-traversal scenario is additionally bounded by a synthetic scenario-file sandbox so it cannot traverse into arbitrary host files.

## Docker Lab

Start on a machine with Docker:

Linux:

```bash
bash scripts/start_environment.sh
bash scripts/verify_docker_isolation.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\start_environment.ps1
.\scripts\verify_docker_isolation.ps1
```

The dummy app is published only at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The controlled executor has no published port and uses only the externally
isolated `security-lab` Docker network.

See `docs/DOCKER_LAB.md`.

## Policy Layer

Trusted registry configuration:

```text
config/targets/
config/security_tests/
```

Deterministic authorization:

```text
services/target_registry.py
orchestrator/policy_engine.py
orchestrator/limits.py
```

Unknown targets, destinations, endpoints, methods, test IDs, privileged paths,
invalid workflow transitions, and exhausted budgets fail closed.

See `docs/POLICY_ENGINE.md`.

## Controlled Security-Test Harness

Registered implementations:

```text
security_tests/
```

Executor:

```text
services/controlled_executor.py
```

The executor builds local requests only from trusted registry/configuration and
fixed templates. It does not accept raw URLs or free-form payloads.

Runtime verification:

```bash
bash scripts/reset_environment.sh
bash scripts/verify_docker_isolation.sh
bash scripts/verify_registered_tests.sh
```

See `docs/SECURITY_TEST_HARNESS.md`.

## Next Task

**Close the Milestone 8 Docker/runtime verification gate.**

The local implementation and full automated suite pass, but Milestone 8 remains incomplete until the development-laptop Docker verification in `docs/RED_TEAM_MVP.md` succeeds. Do not begin Blue Team implementation until that gate is closed.
